# Assessing Short and Long Term Malaria Transmission and Burden Under Various Vaccination Scenarios: A Machine Learning-Based Approach

## Abstract
Malaria continues to be a highly life-threatening disease in sub-Saharan Africa. The 2022 World
Malaria Report notes a slight increase in global cases, rising from 245 million in 2020 to approximately
247 million in 2021. In recent years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has earnestly
addressed the fight against malaria. It has formally sanctioned the adoption and recommendation
of two vaccines: RTS,S/ASO1 (Mosquirix®) and R21/Matrix-M™ (R21/MM). The rollout of vaccination programs
is slated to commence in 2023, raising questions about the efficacy of vaccination
in achieving the ambitious aim of eradicating malaria over the next five decades. This study proposes
a modeling approach using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neurons to forecast the trends of malaria
incidence and mortality under three vaccination scenarios until 2070. The two meticulously chosen models,
devoid of overfitting or underfitting issues post their training on the data, achieved a noteworthy score (R2)
of 91.6% and 86.8% on the test set. Projections for the next half-century indicate that, on the whole,
vaccination strategies curtail the malaria burden in the examined countries in the mid-to-long term,
compared to scenarios without vaccination. Further analysis reveals that the scenario employing the R21 vaccine
exhibits potential in reducing malaria incidence, whereas the RTS vaccine scenario demonstrates effectiveness 
in minimizing deaths compared to the R21 scenario. However, even in the most optimistic scenario witnessed
for Nigeria in the long run, the models don’t foresee complete eradication of malaria by 2070.
Consequently, countries must not solely rely on vaccination but must also implement decisive measures to swiftly
eliminate the looming threat of malaria.
